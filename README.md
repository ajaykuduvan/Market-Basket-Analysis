# Market-Basket-Analysis

ABSTRACT
Market Basket Analysis is one of the key techniques used by large retailers to
uncover associations between items. It works by looking for combinations of
items that occur together frequently in transactions. To put it another way, it
allows retailers to identify relationships between the items that people buy.
Association Rules are widely used to analyze retail basket or transaction data, and
are intended to identify strong rules discovered in transaction data using measures
of interestingness, based on the concept of strong rules. The outcome of this type
of technique is, in simple terms, a set of rules that can be understood as “if this,
then that”. Association rule mining finds interesting associations and
relationships among large sets of data items. This rule shows how frequently an
itemset occurs in a transaction. The project is developed by applying and utilizing
the Association rules on the data item list. Here, Association rule is used in sucha
way that by importing the Apriori module. Apriori module is the concept from
Machine Learning. Here, Machine Learning concept is utilized using Python to
achieve the aspect of the Project. Given a set of transactions, we can find rules
that will predict the occurrence of an item based on the occurrences of other items
in the transactions. Here before applying the rule to the data set, the basic
definitions such as Support count, Frequent Itemset are ensured from the data set
that is passed to the system. Once these terms are ensured from the data set, then
the Evaluation Metrics such as Support, Confidence and Lift value are noticed
from the data set. Once done, then the Association rule from Apriori module is
applied to the dataset. This is termed as applying data mining to the dataset. Then
the Market Basket is analyzed for the most frequent item/product bought by the
customer.
